# Cloud Development Envirnoments (CDEs)

A cloud development environment (CDE) is a virtual container for code development. CDEs are on-demand and come pre-configured with all the tools, libraries, and dependencies needed to code. 

A cloud-based development environment works by connecting a browser to a remote server that runs the cloud IDE. The server handles the compiling, executing, and debugging of the code, while the browser displays the user interface. 
Cloud development is the process of building, testing, deploying, and running software services in the cloud.
