2. **Choose a pre-trained model:** Browse the Hugging Face model hub to find a model suitable for your desired task.
3. **Load the model:** Use the `AutoModelForX` class, where X is the specific task (e.g., `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` for text classification).
4. **Preprocess your data:** Prepare your data in the format expected by the model (e.g., tokenized text).
5. **Make predictions:** Pass your data through the model to obtain predictions or outputs.
6. **Fine-tune the model (optional):** If desired, you can fine-tune the model with your own data for better performance.
