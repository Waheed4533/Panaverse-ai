# Generative Engineering (GenEng)

GenEng revolution being led by developers who build deep proficiency in how to best leverage and integrate generative AI technologies into applications

 There is a clear separation of roles between those that create and train models (Data Scientists and Engineers) and those who use those models (Developers). This was already on the way, and it much clearer with the GenAI revolution - the future of the GenAI will be determined on how it will be driven to adoption - and it will be driven by how developers adopt it.

 GenEng practitioners will need to have many of the same skills of traditional application development, including scalable architecting, integrating enterprise systems, and understanding requirements from the business user. These skills will be augmented with the nuances of building generative AI applications, such as involving the business domain experts in validating aspects of prompt engineering and choosing the right LLM based on price/performance and outcomes

## "ChatGPT API" or correctly: OpenAI API

OpenAI API is a collection of APIs

APIs offer access to various Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLM: Program trained to understand human language

ChatGPT is a web service using the Chat completion API
Uses:

1. gpt-3.5-turbo (free tier)
2. gpt-4.0 (paid tier)

## OpenAI API endpoints

1. Chat completion:
Given a series of messages, generate a response

2. Function calling: 
Choose which function to call

3. Image generation:
Given a text description generate an image

4. Speech to text:
Given an audio file and a prompt generate a transcript

5. Fine tuning:
Train a model using input and output examples

## OpenAI Assistants API

The new Assistants API is a stateful evolution of Chat Completions API meant to simplify the creation of assistant-like experiences, and enable developer access to powerful tools like Code Interpreter and Retrieval.

![Alt text](assistants.png "Assistants")

## Chat Completions API vs Assistants API

The primitives of the Chat Completions API are Messages, on which you perform a Completion with a Model (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, etc). It is lightweight and powerful, but inherently stateless, which means you have to manage conversation state, tool definitions, retrieval documents, and code execution manually.

The primitives of the Assistants API are

1. Assistants, which encapsulate a base model, instructions, tools, and (context) documents,
2. Threads, which represent the state of a conversation, and
3. Runs, which power the execution of an Assistant on a Thread, including textual responses and multi-step tool use.

## What is the OPL stack in AI?

The OPL Stack stands for OpenAI, Pinecone, and Langchain. It's a collection of open-source tools and libraries that make building and deploying LLMs a breeze.

## The Future of Generative AI

“AI will be the greatest wealth creator in history because artificial intelligence doesn’t care where you were born, whether you have money, whether you have a PhD,” Higgins tells CNBC Make It. “It’s going to destroy barriers that have prevented people from moving up the ladder, and pursuing their dream of economic freedom.”

It’s already valued at almost $100 billion, and expected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.

“It’s not that if you don’t jump on it now, you never can,” Higgins says. “It’s that now is the greatest opportunity for you to capitalize on it.”
