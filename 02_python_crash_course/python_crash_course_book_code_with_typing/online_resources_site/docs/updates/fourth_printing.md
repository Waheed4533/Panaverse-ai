# Updates and Errata - Fourth printing

This page is broken into two parts, Updates and Errata. *Updates* address issues that affect whether your code will run or not. *Errata* refer to minor issues such as typos, and errors in grayed-out code that probably won’t affect the code you’re entering.

Code that produces warnings but still runs correctly is noted under Errata, as this is a fairly common occurrence and the code often still works for a long time while producing warnings.

If you find an error in the book that's not listed here, or can’t get something to work, please let me know. You can reach me through email at ehmatthes@gmail.com, or on Twitter at @ehmatthes.
