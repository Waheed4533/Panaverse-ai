# Cheat Sheets

![Beginner's Python Cheat Sheets, first page](images/pcc_3e_cheat_sheet_image_corner.png){ align=right }

Cheat sheets can be really helpful when youâ€™re trying a set of exercises related to a specific topic, or working on a project. Because you can only fit so much information on a single sheet of paper, most cheat sheets are a simple listing of syntax rules. This set of cheat sheets aims to remind you of syntax rules, but also remind you of important concepts as well.

You can download [all of the sheets in a single color document](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_3e/releases/download/v1.0.0/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc_all.pdf). You can also download a [zip file](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_3e/releases/download/v1.0.0/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_all.zip) containing all color and printer-friendly black and white versions.

The full set includes:

- An overview sheet covering a wide range of topics
- A series of sheets that focus on the fundamentals of Python
- A series of sheets focusing on specific libraries: pytest, Pygame, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Django
- A sheet focusing on Git basics

These sheets are completely free to use and share. I originally wrote them as a way to support readers of Python Crash Course, but they've proven useful to people working through a wide range of Python learning resources as well. (If you find them useful and want to see more of my writing on Python, check out my ongoing work at [Mostly Python](https://mostlypython.substack.com).)
