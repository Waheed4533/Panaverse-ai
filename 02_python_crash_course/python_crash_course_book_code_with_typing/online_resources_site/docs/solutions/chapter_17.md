## 17-1: Other Languages

Modify the API call in *python_repos.py* so it generates a chart showing the most popular projects in other languages. Try languages such as *JavaScript*, *Ruby*, *C*, *Java*, *Perl*, *Haskell*, and *Go*.

```python title="javascript_repos.py"
import requests
import plotly.express as px


# Make an API call and check the response.
url = "https://api.github.com/search/repositories"
url += "?q=language:javascript+sort:stars+stars:>10000"

headers = {"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"}
r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(f"Status code: {r.status_code}")

# Process overall results.
response_dict = r.json()
print(f"Complete results: {not response_dict['incomplete_results']}")

# Process repository information.
repo_dicts = response_dict['items']
repo_links, stars, hover_texts = [], [], []
for repo_dict in repo_dicts:
    # Turn repo names into active links.
    repo_name = repo_dict['name']
    repo_url = repo_dict['html_url']
    repo_link = f"<a href='{repo_url}'>{repo_name}</a>"
    repo_links.append(repo_link)

    stars.append(repo_dict['stargazers_count'])

    # Build hover texts.
    owner = repo_dict['owner']['login']
    description = repo_dict['description']
    hover_text = f"{owner}<br />{description}"
    hover_texts.append(hover_text)

# Make visualization.
title = "Most-Starred JavaScript Projects on GitHub"
labels = {'x': 'Repository', 'y': 'Stars'}
fig = px.bar(x=repo_links, y=stars, title=title, labels=labels,
        hover_name=hover_texts)

fig.update_layout(title_font_size=28, xaxis_title_font_size=20,
        yaxis_title_font_size=20)

fig.update_traces(marker_color='SteelBlue', marker_opacity=0.6)

fig.show()
```

Output:

## 17-2: Active Discussions

Using the data from *hn_submissions.py*, make a bar chart showing the most active discussions currently happening on Hacker News. The height of each bar should correspond to the number of comments each submission has. The label for each bar should include the submissionâ€™s title and act as a link to the discussion page for that submission. If you get a `KeyError` when creating a chart, use a try-except block to skip over the promotional posts.

```python title="hn_discussions_visual.py"
from operator import itemgetter

import requests
import plotly.express as px


# Make an API call and check the response.
url = 'https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json'
r = requests.get(url)
print(f"Status code: {r.status_code}")

# Process information about each submission.
submission_ids = r.json()

submission_dicts = []
for submission_id in submission_ids[:20]:
    # Make a new API call for each submission.
    url = f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{submission_id}.json"
    r = requests.get(url)
    print(f"id: {submission_id}\tstatus: {r.status_code}")
    response_dict = r.json()
    
    # Build a dictionary for each article.
    try:
        submission_dict = {
            'title': response_dict['title'],
            'hn_link': f"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id={submission_id}",
            'comments': response_dict['descendants'],
        }
    except KeyError:
        # This is a special YC post with comments disabled.
        continue
    else:
        submission_dicts.append(submission_dict)

submission_dicts = sorted(submission_dicts, key=itemgetter('comments'),
                            reverse=True)

# Process data for plotting.
article_links, comment_counts, hover_texts = [], [], []
for submission_dict in submission_dicts:
    # Shorten long article titles.
    title = submission_dict['title'][:30]
    discussion_link = submission_dict['hn_link']
    article_link = f'<a href="{discussion_link}"">{title}</a>'
    comment_count = submission_dict['comments']

    article_links.append(article_link)
    comment_counts.append(comment_count)
    # Show the full title on hover.
    hover_texts.append(submission_dict['title'])

# Make visualization.
title = "Most active discussions on Hacker News"
labels = {'x': 'Article', 'y': 'Comment count'}
fig = px.bar(x=article_links, y=comment_counts, title=title, labels=labels,
        hover_name=hover_texts)

fig.update_layout(title_font_size=28, xaxis_title_font_size=20,
        yaxis_title_font_size=20)

fig.update_traces(marker_color='SteelBlue', marker_opacity=0.6)

fig.show()
```

Output:

## 17-3 Testing python_repos.py

In *python_repos.py*, we printed the value of `status_code` to make sure the API call was successful. Write a program called *test_python_repos.py* that uses `pytest` to assert that the value of `status_code`
is 200. Figure out some other assertions you can make: for example, that the number of items returned is expected and that the total number of repositories is greater than a certain amount.

***Note:** It's much easier to test a program that's broken up into functions or classes. So this solution actually has three parts: a version of python_repos.py that uses functions to do its work, a simpler test file, and a test file that uses fixtures.*

```python title="python_repos_tested.py"
import requests

def get_repos_info():
    """Get information about Python repositories on GitHub."""
    # Make an API call and check the response.
    url = "https://api.github.com/search/repositories"
    url += "?q=language:python+sort:stars+stars:>10000"

    headers = {"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"}
    r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

    print(f"Status code: {r.status_code}")

    return r

def get_response_dict(response):
    """Convert the response object to a dictionary."""
    response_dict = response.json()
    return response_dict

def show_repos_info(response_dict):
    """Show information about the returned repositories."""
    print(f"Total repositories: {response_dict['total_count']}")
    print(f"Complete results: {not response_dict['incomplete_results']}")

def get_repo_dicts(response_dict):
    """Return list of dictionaries, one for each repository."""
    repo_dicts = response_dict['items']
    return repo_dicts

def show_repo_dicts_info(repo_dicts):
    """Summarize information about repositories."""
    print(f"Repositories returned: {len(repo_dicts)}")

    print("\nSelected information about each repository:")
    for repo_dict in repo_dicts:
        print("\nSelected information about first repository:")
        print(f"Name: {repo_dict['name']}")
        print(f"Owner: {repo_dict['owner']['login']}")
        print(f"Stars: {repo_dict['stargazers_count']}")
        print(f"Repository: {repo_dict['html_url']}")
        print(f"Created: {repo_dict['created_at']}")
        print(f"Updated: {repo_dict['updated_at']}")
        print(f"Description: {repo_dict['description']}")

response = get_repos_info()
response_dict = get_response_dict(response)
show_repos_info(response_dict)
repo_dicts = get_repo_dicts(response_dict)
show_repo_dicts_info(repo_dicts)
```

Output:

```
Status code: 200
Total repositories: 307
Complete results: True
Repositories returned: 30

Selected information about each repository:

Selected information about first repository:
Name: public-apis
Owner: public-apis
Stars: 227342

Updated: 2023-02-08T01:53:56Z

...
```

Here's a version of *test_python_repos.py* that does not use fixtures:

```python title="test_python_repos.py"
import pytest

from python_repos_tested import get_repos_info, get_response_dict, get_repo_dicts


def test_response_status_code():
    """Test that a response has a successful status code."""
    r = get_repos_info()
    assert r.status_code == 200

def test_response_dict():
    """Verify an appropriate number of repositories are represented,
    and the results are complete.
    """
    r = get_repos_info()
    response_dict = get_response_dict(r)

    total_count = response_dict['total_count']
    complete_results = not response_dict['incomplete_results']

    assert total_count > 240
    assert complete_results

def test_repo_dicts():
    """Verify the results in repo_dicts are correct."""
    r = get_repos_info()
    response_dict = get_response_dict(r)
    repo_dicts = get_repo_dicts(response_dict)

    assert len(repo_dicts) == 30

    # Check that all repos returned have over 10k stars.
    for repo_dict in repo_dicts:
        assert repo_dict['stargazers_count'] > 10_000
```

Output:

```

This is a reasonable first pass at writing these three tests. But you might notice that every test function needs to call `get_repos_info()`, which means there's one API call for every single test function. That would quickly get out of hand.

Here's the same three tests, using a fixture to make sure that `get_repos_info()` is only called once for the entire test run:

```python title="test_python_repos_with_fixture.py"
import pytest

from python_repos_tested import get_repos_info, get_response_dict, get_repo_dicts


@pytest.fixture
def response():
    """Get a response object."""
    r = get_repos_info()
    return r

def test_response_status_code(response):
    """Test that a response has a successful status code."""
    assert response.status_code == 200

def test_response_dict(response):
    """Verify an appropriate number of repositories are represented,
    and the results are complete.
    """
    response_dict = get_response_dict(response)

    total_count = response_dict['total_count']
    complete_results = not response_dict['incomplete_results']

    assert total_count > 240
    assert complete_results

def test_repo_dicts(response):
    """Verify the results in repo_dicts are correct."""
    response_dict = get_response_dict(response)
    repo_dicts = get_repo_dicts(response_dict)

    assert len(repo_dicts) == 30

    # Check that all repos returned have over 10k stars.
    for repo_dict in repo_dicts:
        assert repo_dict['stargazers_count'] > 10_000
```

Output:

```
$ pytest test_python_repos_with_fixture.py

```

***Note:** The times reported by pytest are not representative of the entire time it takes to run the test suite. Some of the time that's spent waiting for network calls is not counted by pytest. If you time these two test runs with a stopwatch or another non-pytest timer, you'll find that the file using a fixture runs significantly faster than the file without a fixture. This difference would become even more significant as the number of test functions grows.*
