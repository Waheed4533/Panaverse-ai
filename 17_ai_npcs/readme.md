## What are AI NPC Character Engines?

[Why Character Engines are game engines for AI NPCs](https://inworld.ai/blog/what-is-a-character-engine-a-game-engine-for-ai-npcs)

A Character Engine is a development environment that offers a suite of tools and features that help game developers create and deploy real-time generative AI-powered NPCs in video games. Essentially, itâ€™s like a game engine but for generative AI character creation. 

**Without a Character Engine, developers would have to integrate a large language model API directly, add in speech-to-text, set up text-to-speech, build an emotions engine, connect a characterâ€™s emotions to their lip sync, facial expressions, and animations, engineer an efficient backend architecture to ensure low latency, build in scalability, create ways to support concurrent sessions, customize their safety settings, write dynamic prompts, tackle LLM hallucinations, and much more. Thatâ€™s a lot of additional work!**

Like game engines, Character Engines are efficient and cost-effective ways for developers to add dynamic interaction capabilities to their gaming experiences without having to hire a machine learning team and architect it all themselves for every game they create.

Both talking avatars and AI NPCs involve some form of interactive character, but they have distinct differences in their goals, functionalities, and applications. Here's a breakdown:

**Talking avatars:**

* **Focus:** Primarily on **representing a user or entity in a virtual space or online environment.**
* **Functionality:** 
    * Mimic the user's movements and gestures through motion capture or animation.
    * Speak on behalf of the user using text-to-speech or pre-recorded audio.
    * May express emotions and reactions visually or through voice modulation.
* **Use cases:**
    * Virtual reality applications where users interact with others through their avatars.
    * Online collaboration platforms where users present themselves visually.
    * Educational simulations where students engage with virtual characters as guides.
    * Gaming where players customize and control their in-game avatars.

**AI NPCs:**

* **Focus:** On simulating **autonomous characters with independent behaviors and interactions.**
* **Functionality:**
    * Make their own decisions and react to the environment and other characters.
    * Engage in conversations with users using natural language processing (NLP).
    * Perform tasks or provide assistance within their programmed goals.
    * Learn and adapt their behavior over time based on interactions and data.
* **Use cases:**
    * Open-world video games where NPCs populate the world and offer quests or information.
    * Social robots or virtual assistants that interact with humans in real-world settings.
    * Training simulations where users practice communication or negotiation skills with AI characters.
    * Customer service chatbots that handle basic inquiries and provide support.

**Key differences:**
