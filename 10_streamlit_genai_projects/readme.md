# Building Streamlit GenAI Projects

OpenAI's Assistants API allows developers to use the same qualities that make ChatGPT the best chatbot in their own applications. The Assistants API can be used to create advanced Streamlit applications for financial analysis, engineering, medicine, and document processing, etc.
